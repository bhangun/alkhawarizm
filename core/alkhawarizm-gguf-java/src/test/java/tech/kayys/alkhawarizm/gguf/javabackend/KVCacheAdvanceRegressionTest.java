/**
 * Regression test for the bug found while porting {@code LlamaForward}'s
 * algorithm into {@link GgufDecodeStep}: the ported-from code called
 * {@link KVCache#store} for every layer at every position but never called
 * {@link KVCache#advance()} — since {@code store} writes at the cache's own
 * internal {@code seqLen}, which only moves forward via {@code advance()},
 * every token was silently overwriting position 0 instead of accumulating
 * history. Wrong output, no exception — the kind of bug that survives a
 * "does it produce plausible-looking text" smoke test.
 *
 * <p>This test proves the fix: writing at two positions with
 * {@code advance()} called between them, both positions' data survive in
 * the cache afterward. If {@code advance()} were removed again (or a future
 * edit re-introduces the same mistake in a different call site), the second
 * assertion below fails immediately instead of the bug hiding until
 * multi-token generation looks subtly wrong.</p>
